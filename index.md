## Introduction

Welcome to the OWASP Frankfurt Chapter, your regional city chapter within [OWASP Germany](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/). Located in the heart of Germany's financial hub, our chapter serves as a nexus for security professionals, AppSec enthusiasts, and experts alike.

Whether you're a seasoned cybersecurity practitioner, a developer, a consultant, or someone simply curious about software and application security, OWASP Frankfurt Chapter offers a platform for learning and networking. Through a variety of events and initiatives, we strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute, learn, and grow.
